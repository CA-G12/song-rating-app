# Musify App

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Project

In this project we will be working on a music app that searches for the latest music hits regarding your search words

### User Journey
- The user will open the website to see few suggested songs for the day
- The user can search for songs to see the latest hits that match the search term
- The user can search for artist names to see their latest and most popular songs
- The user will be able to click on the play button on the song card to be sent to an external web page that views the song lyrics

## âœ§ How to install the project on your local machine.

- You can click the _code_ drop-down menu and copy the link to clone the repo.
- Now go to your terminal and type: `git clone <the link here>` and then the repo will be cloned to your local machine.
- By now you have to open your IDE -I recommend VSCode- and open the project.
- In terminal, run the following commands:
    ```cmd
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    you should see a messaage telling you that the server is running on a certain port.
